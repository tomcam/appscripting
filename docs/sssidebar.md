# Google Apps Script Tutorial: Creating a Spreadsheet app with sidebar

Most Apps Script programs start with some kind of user input. That normally requires a form.
Forms are built from Javascript code in Google Apps. This one will appear as a sidebar
on a spreadsheet.

* You log in to Google by starting at Gmail. Log in, then choose the Google Apps icon.
* Visit the [Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/) link, and choose **Start a new spreadsheet**.
* From the spreadsheet's **Tools** menu, choose **Script Editor**.
The editor appears and you're already in a file named `Code.gs`, but it's not necessary.
* From the **File** menu, choose **New**, then **HTML file**.
